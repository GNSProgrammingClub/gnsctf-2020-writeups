# gnsCTF 2020 Writeups
Writeups for gnsCTF 2020 challenges

To writers: I would prefer that writeups are in a folder for the relevant category. This main README will be edited later with a table or something for each challenge. Other than that, make sure you put relevant information like descriptions, hints, points, authors, etc.
